To compile:
-----------
  'make'

To remove the binaries:
-----------------------
  'make clean'

To run the test case: 
---------------------
type './orderbook' in the project directory


If more time is available the parser for the input file can be developed, another point is 
to use only 2 maps ; one with Map<price, qty> and another with Map<OrderId,OrderDetails>
